# EARLY RELEASE, NOT COMPLETELY FINISHED

Panglia is a planet that follows Moshine in the quest for even more intelligence.
It's a strange alien planet that contains Branbalite, a phosphorescent plant, and panglite, a strange metal. Some zones are experiencing much faster time, which will allow you to experiment with cloning, then keep clones in simulations and upload them. You'll need to fill the huge electric needs with dangerous roots that expand and attack your base.

It has custom music, unique terrain, a tech tree, 4 new machines...

Right now, it requires Moshine.

Feedback very welcome, here or discord @snouz. The things I'm most interested in tweaking based on feedback: 
- recipe price, time and probability
- the speed of speedy zones (can be cheaty for other parts of the game?)
- resource input from the "universe incubator" (not too high that it can unbalance the game)
- electrical balance using panderoots (root input vs machine needs) (the electricity needed has to be so high that the only reasonable way to obtain is with panderoots)
- probability of panderoots and speedy zones

This is very early access, the experience is probably not balanced yet.
